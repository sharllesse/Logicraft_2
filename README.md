# Logicraft 2

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a personal learning sandbox. Being a student, I've worked on many group, solo, or obscure projects where I've been implementing many features.
> 
> I have been very frustrated not to push these features further, so I decided to make this repository to test out things I never did or learn more about features I never dove deep into.
> 
> **Expect experimental prototypes:** I will do prototypes for many things. Prototypes are not made to look good, they are a way to test out the feature I want to learn. The code might be messy or unstable.

## Project Goal
I have a strong interest in learning new technologies.
For this project, my goal is to achieve and architect a Unity-Like Game Engine.

I really like the Unity's user-friendly approach and its underlying architecture, everything is pretty simple and self-explanatory. 
And I really like the C++, despite the occasional depression when a bug takes a week to fix and its horrible way of showing errors.

**The Architecture Plan:** I aim to replicate a hybrid structure using C# Interop (P/Invoke):
- C++ (Native): Handles the "heavy lifting," complicated systems, and performance-critical tasks.
- C# (Managed): Handles the Scripting layer, Editor, and UI tools.

> [!NOTE]
> I will later update the README with "how to clone it and build it" and multiple other instructions.
